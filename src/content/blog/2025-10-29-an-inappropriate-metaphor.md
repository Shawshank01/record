Many people claim AI tools are scams, AI is unreliable, and AI is riddled with hallucinations. I believe that when you encounter such issues, the problem most likely isn't with the AI itself, but rather how you're using it.

Let's take a light bulb as an example. A light bulb is designed to be screwed into a socket, powered on, and used to illuminate its surroundings. But if you insist on using it as a sex toy and shove it into your ass, you can certainly do that, however, you also run the risk of the bulb getting stuck. Because the bulb wasn't designed for that purpose. It can do it, but it doesn't do it well.

Similarly, if you can't articulate your own thoughts clearly, or worse, use incorrect phrasing to prompt AI responses, the AI will misinterpret your input and deliver inaccurate information. It can do, but not good, just like how you use the bulb.

This is precisely why everyone should learn how to become a master AI prompt engineer, to use AI correctly, and make your life easier.
