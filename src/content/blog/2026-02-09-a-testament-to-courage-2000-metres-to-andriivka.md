I finished watching the documentary [2000 Metres to Andriivka](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt34964205/) today.

To be honest, it was hard to watch. I don't even remember how many times I pressed pause during the first ten minutes, especially during the first final scene, I felt desperate just looking at the screen. I can't even express my complex emotions in words.

But as I mustered the courage to keep watching, I realised that opening scene was far from the beginning of hell. Although I've seen plenty of footage from drone perspectives showing buildings destroyed, tanks blown up, and even attacks on Russian soldiers, those videos always cut off the instant the drone explodes. This time, however, I witness the battlefield through the first-person perspective of helmet-mounted cameras worn by brave Ukrainian soldiers.

I follow the courageous Ukrainian fighters as I hear their battle cries and anguished shouts, feel the whistling of bullets tearing through the air, experience the shockwaves of bombs exploding nearby, and see fallen brothers who never rise again... That constant dread of what horrors might unfold in the next second, even through the screen, does nothing to ease my taut nerves. I find myself hitting the pause button more and more frequently, trying to suppress the rising nausea.

Trust me, even if you think you're desensitised to *Saving Private Ryan*-level scenes, you have no idea what you're about to face.

War, war never changes. Perhaps in my lifetime, I may not witness humanity breaking free from the painful cycle of war, but I have never ceased to envision a beautiful future where mankind eradicates war and advances hand in hand.

可随着我鼓起勇气继续观看，我才发现我刚刚只是站在地狱的入口处。虽然我从无人机视角看过不少摧毁建筑，炸毁坦克，甚至攻击俄军士兵的场景，但那些视频在无人机爆炸的钱一瞬间就断掉了。而这次是通过士兵身上携带的头盔摄像头，以第一人称的视角，跟随英勇的乌克兰战士来观测战场。

战士们的怒吼，哀嚎，子弹在空中划过的声音，炸弹在身旁爆炸的震撼，倒下的战友再也没能站起来…… 我每时每刻都不在担心着下一秒又会有什么坏事发生，哪怕隔着屏幕，也丝毫无法缓和我紧绷的神经。我只能更加频繁地按下暂定键，试图压下那反胃的感觉。

相信我，就算你认为你已经适应了《拯救大兵瑞恩》级别的场景，你也并不知道自己将要面临什么。

War, war never changes. 或许在我的有生之年，无法看到人类脱离战争的痛苦轮回，但我从未停止对人类根绝战争，携手共进的美好未来的畅想。

This documentary, produced and directed by Mstyslav Chernov, was released on 23 January 2025. I believe the Nobel Peace Prize should be awarded to individuals like those who courageously risk their lives on the front lines to defence their homeland, document and expose the brutal realities of war to the world.

Thank you for reading. Please watch the documentary when you are ready. It's worth experiencing the pain.

If you're interested in learning more about Ukraine's history, I recommend another documentary: [Winter on Fire](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4908644/), which chronicles the events of 2013-2014.

Слава Україні! 🇺🇦
